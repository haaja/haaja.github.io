      <description>I recently wrote about leaving Google Reader. Of course this decision was made for me when Google announced that they will shutdown Google Creader on 1st of July. In the beginning I simply used thunderbird as my RSS reader but eventually this became too limited as for instance I couldn&amp;rsquo;t easily access my thunderbird installation from work. Then I switched to theoldreader which is more or less a Google Reader clone with additional features.</description>

      <description>So yesterday Google announced that they will retire Google Reader. At first this annoyed me since to me Google Reader was their best service after Google Search of course. Luckily there are plenty of alternatives and for now I chose Thunderbird as I already use it for email.
Good riddance!
