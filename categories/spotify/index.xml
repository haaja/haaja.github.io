      <description>Edit: This works for version 0.6.2 as well.
Spotify is a popular music streaming service which unfortunately isn&amp;rsquo;t globally available. Here in Finland we have had the opportunity to enjoy Spotify from the begining which is a rare thing. For a minuscule amount of 9.99â‚¬ you&amp;rsquo;ll have pretty much unlimited collection of music at your hands and on your mobile phone. Ok, granted not every artist has their music in Spotify but the collection is huge!</description>
