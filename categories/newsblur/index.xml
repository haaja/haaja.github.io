      <description>I recently wrote about leaving Google Reader. Of course this decision was made for me when Google announced that they will shutdown Google Creader on 1st of July. In the beginning I simply used thunderbird as my RSS reader but eventually this became too limited as for instance I couldn&amp;rsquo;t easily access my thunderbird installation from work. Then I switched to theoldreader which is more or less a Google Reader clone with additional features.</description>
