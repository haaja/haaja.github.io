      <description>Today at work I was trying to get my virtual machine, running Fedora, to access internet. Unfortunately the place I work is pretty much married to products from Microsoft. All the networking to the outside world go through proxies and in this case through Microsoft ISA. ISA uses NTLMv2 authentication mechanism which is not supported out of the box by Linux. Luckily there was multiple applications that were able to act as a man in the middle proxy, such as cntlm and NTLAMPS.</description>
